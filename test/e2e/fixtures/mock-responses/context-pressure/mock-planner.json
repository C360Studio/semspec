  "goal": "Build a Go web API with JWT authentication middleware, RESTful endpoint handlers, and a PostgreSQL-backed data layer including database migrations and full test coverage for authentication.",
  "context": "The project is a Go web API (auth/middleware.go, api/handlers.go, db/store.go) with three primary packages: auth for JWT middleware, api for HTTP handlers, and db for database operations. The codebase needs JWT authentication wired into protected routes, CRUD endpoint handlers for resources, and a database access layer backed by PostgreSQL. A database migration file will initialize the schema. Tests for the authentication middleware are required by SOP and are explicitly included in scope.",
