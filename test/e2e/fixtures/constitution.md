## Principles

### 1. Testing Required

All changes must include a Testing section in their specification.
Specifications without testing documentation will not be approved.

Rationale: Testing ensures code quality and prevents regressions.

### 2. Clear Requirements

All changes must clearly document their requirements.
Vague or missing requirements will cause approval to fail.

Rationale: Clear requirements enable proper implementation and review.

### 3. Implementation Details

All changes must describe their implementation approach.
This helps reviewers understand the technical approach.

Rationale: Technical clarity improves review quality and knowledge sharing.
