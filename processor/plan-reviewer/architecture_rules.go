// mergeArchitectureFindings runs the ADR-043 PR 2 architecture-round structural
// rules over a plan + review result and appends any deterministic findings.
// These rules layer on top of the workflow validators that architecture-generator
// runs at parse-time — the architect should fail-fast there, but the rules
// here are a defensive backstop for the case where an operator-edited plan
// or a future relaxed validator lets a malformed architecture reach review.
//
// Rules (R2 architecture round):
//   - architecture.component_missing_implementation_files: ComponentDef with
//     empty ImplementationFiles. One finding per offending component.
//   - architecture.component_implementation_files_doc_only: ComponentDef whose
//     ImplementationFiles contain only documentation-extension files. The
//     architect-side equivalent of capability.orphan.docs_only — catches the
//     run-#3 docs-only fingerprint upstream of Sarah's story-prep phase so
//     the regen cycle hits Winston, not John.
//   - capability.unresolved_in_architecture: a Capability.Name from
//     plan.Exploration whose name doesn't appear in any ComponentDef's
//     Capabilities list. Winston didn't map this capability to a component.
//
// Skipped entirely when plan.Architecture is nil (legacy plans without
// the architecture-generator phase have no components to check), when
// plan.Exploration is nil (no capabilities to cross-reference), or when
// ComponentBoundaries is empty.
//
// Side effect: calls result.NormalizeVerdict() so the verdict reflects the
// merged findings ("approved" → "needs_changes" when error findings appear).
