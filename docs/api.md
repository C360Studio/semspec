# API Reference

Semspec exposes a REST API at `http://localhost:8080`. Routes are mounted at
`/{component-name}/...`, where the component name is the instance key from
`configs/semspec.json`.

**Interactive docs**: `http://localhost:8080/docs` (Swagger UI playground)
**OpenAPI spec**: `http://localhost:8080/openapi.json` (machine-readable)

> **Note**: The generated OpenAPI document currently lists plan-manager paths
> under `/plan-api/...` due to legacy spec strings in
> `processor/plan-manager/openapi.go`. Live routes are mounted under
> `/plan-manager/...` (see e2e client `test/e2e/client/http.go`). Trust this
> document over Swagger for plan-manager paths until the spec is fixed.

> buckets.

## Plan Lifecycle

The plan-manager owns the `PLAN_STATES` KV bucket. Status transitions are
defined in `workflow/types.go`. The happy path:

```
created → drafting → drafted → reviewing_draft → reviewed → approved
       → generating_architecture → architecture_generated
       → generating_requirements → requirements_generated
       → generating_scenarios → scenarios_generated
       → reviewing_scenarios → scenarios_reviewed → ready_for_execution
       → implementing
       → ready_for_qa (qa_level=unit/integration/full only)
       → reviewing_qa
       → complete
```

Other reachable statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `revision_needed` | Plan-reviewer rejected; planner retries (max 3) |
| `awaiting_review` | Human gate (auto-approve disabled) |
| `changed` | Plan was edited mid-flight; re-evaluation pending |
| `rejected` | Reviewer or QA rejected; PlanDecisions describe the issues |
| `archived` | Plan archived via `POST .../archive` |
| `reviewing_rollup` | Legacy QA stage; kept for in-flight plans on upgrade only |

When `auto_approve=true` (default), `reviewed` flows directly to `approved`
without manual promotion. `qa_level` (project config) controls which path is
taken at the implementing→complete transition:

- `none` — straight to `complete`
- `synthesis` — `implementing → reviewing_qa → complete`
- `unit`/`integration`/`full` — `implementing → ready_for_qa → reviewing_qa → complete`

## SSE Streams

Real-time updates use Server-Sent Events.

| Stream | Events |
|--------|--------|
| `/plan-manager/plans/{slug}/stream` | `plan_updated` — plan stage changes |
| `/execution-manager/plans/{slug}/stream` | `task_updated`, `requirement_updated` — execution progress |
| `/agentic-dispatch/activity` | `event: activity` — loop lifecycle (created/updated/deleted) |
| `/question-manager/questions/stream` | Question lifecycle (asked/answered/timeout) |
| `/message-logger/kv/{bucket}/watch` | KV change stream |

## Response Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `200` | Success |
| `201` | Created |
| `202` | Accepted (async operation started) |
| `204` | Deleted |
| `400` | Bad request |
| `404` | Not found |
| `405` | Method not allowed |
| `409` | Conflict (invalid state transition) |
| `500` | Internal error |
| `503` | Service unavailable (component not ready, sandbox not configured) |
