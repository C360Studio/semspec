// Package spec provides vocabulary predicates for OpenSpec specification documents.
// OpenSpec is a spec-driven development framework that uses structured Markdown
// with requirements, scenarios, and delta change tracking.
//
// This vocabulary supports:
//   - Source of truth specifications with requirements and scenarios
//   - Delta specifications tracking ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED changes
//   - BDD-style scenarios with Given-When-Then structure
//   - Normative language extraction (SHALL/MUST statements)
